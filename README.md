# YimASI

A simple ASI loader that supports loading ScriptHookV mods online

# Usage

1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/xesdoog/YimASI/releases/tag/release) section and download **WTSAPI32.dll**.
2. Place the file inside GTAV's root directory (paste it where GTA5.exe is).
3. Download the latest version of Alexander Blade's [ScriptHookV](http://dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/).
4. Copy **ScriptHookV.dll** and paste it in GTAV's root directory.

That's it. You can now download an asi script such as [VStancer](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/vstancer) and run the game to test it.

> Despite its name, YimASI doesn't need YimMenu to work. You only need the two dlls.

> If you're using heavy mods like NVE and your game crashes, install [Packfile Limit Adjuster](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/packfile-limit-adjuster)
